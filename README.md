## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
   \```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   \```
   cd tic-tac-toe
   \```
3. Install the required package:
   \```
   pip install pygame
   \```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the following command:

\```
python main.py
\```

## File Structure

\```
tic-tac-toe/
├── main.py
└── README.md
\```

- `main.py`: The main script where the game logic resides.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Game Rules

- Two players take turns to place their symbol ('O' or 'X') on the board.
- The first player to align their symbol in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- Press 'r' to restart the game at any time.

## How it Works

- The board is divided into a 3x3 grid.
- The `pygame` library is used to draw the grid and symbols ('O' and 'X') on the board.
- The `numpy` library is used to keep track of the board state.
- The game checks for a win condition after each turn.
